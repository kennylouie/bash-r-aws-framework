# bash-r-aws-framework
bash and r scripts to create a simple framework for data analysis, file transformation, and file management

## background

I am comfrotable working with shell scripting and r. Although I understand there are other frameworks in place, I like to get into the nitty and gritty to make custom and basic level work that achieves a similar outcome. Overall, I use bash for file management on a linux server, while calling r to do the heavy lifting in analysis.

## 1. case study: twitter mining and live analysis

Refer to https://github.com/justdevelopingstuff/twitter-unsupervised-topwords-sentiment-analysis. This was a collaborative effort to 1. scrape twitter; 2. mine tweets related to the EURO cup; 3. parse the data; 4. analyze the data in python/r; 5. produce graphs periodically and 6. push the results for display of live results. - all while on an amazon aws ec2 server to run during the duration of the game.
